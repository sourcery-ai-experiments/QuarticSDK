.. class:: Tag

   Bases: :class:`quartic_sdk.core.entities.base.Base`

   .. method:: data(self, start_time, stop_time, granularity=0, return_type=Constants.RETURN_PANDAS, batch_size=Constants.DEFAULT_PAGE_LIMIT_ROWS, transformations=[])

      Get the data for the given tag between the start_time and the stop_time
      for the given granularity

      :param start_time: (epoch) Start_time for getting data
      :param stop_time: (epoch) Stop_time for getting data
      :param granularity: Granularity of the data
      :param return_type: The param decides whether the data after querying will be
          json(when value is "json") or pandas dataframe(when value is "pd"). By default,
          it takes the value as "json"
      :param transformations: Refers to the list of transformations. It supports either
          interpolation or aggregation, depending upon which, we pass the value of this
          dictionary. If `transformation_type` is "aggregation", an optional key can be
          passed called `aggregation_timestamp`, which determines how the timestamp information
          will be retained after aggregation. Valid options are "first", "last" or "discard". By
          default, the last timestamp in each group will be retained.
          An example value here is:
          [{
              "transformation_type": "interpolation",
              "column": "3",
              "method": "linear"
          }, {
              "transformation_type": "aggregation",
              "aggregation_column": "4",
              "aggregation_dict": {"3": "max"},
              "aggregation_timestamp": "last",
          }]

      :return: (DataIterator) DataIterator object which can be iterated to get the data
          between the given duration

   .. method:: __getattribute__(self, name)

      This method overrides the python's object __getattribute__ method. This is used to
      map some constant value of an object to some meaningful string constants for better
      readability
      :param name: name of the object attribute we want to access for example tag.tag_type
      :return: Either mapped value or raw value with respect to the object attribute
